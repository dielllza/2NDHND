2NDHND short for Second Hand is a web site that allows users to create profile accounts, sign in and sign out of the page that allows users to buy and sell their used stuff.
The goods are categorized in different types such as House, Technology, Clothes, Sports etc. A user can upload a picture add a description about the product, add its prize and the products category.
The products are categorized so that the interested buyers can choose to view only the products of the categories they are interested in by following the categories. 
Each user submits their contact info upon registration so that interested byers can contact them. 
A user can also edit or delete their uploaded product, therefore compleating the four basic functions of persistent storage: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
